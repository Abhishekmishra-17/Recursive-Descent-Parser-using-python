# Recursive-Descent-Parser-using-python
This is program of recursive descent parser using Python programming language.

# Recursive Descent Parser:
It is a kind of Top-Down Parser. A top-down parser builds the parse tree from the top to down, starting with the start non-terminal. A Predictive Parser is a special case of Recursive Descent Parser, where no Back Tracking is required.
By carefully writing a grammar means eliminating left recursion and left factoring from it, the resulting grammar will be a grammar that can be parsed by a recursive descent parser.


**Here 'i' is Epsilon or any terminals symbol.**

For Recursive Descent Parser, we are going to write one program for every variable.
